# Hashcatomator
A small tool to automatize wordlist attacks on Truecrypt and Veracrypt Volumes using Hashcat

What it does:
- works his way through all Truecrypt/Veracrypt Hashcat Methods in all combinations as seen below
- automatically uses all dictionaries in the given folder

What do you need:
- Hashcat preinstalled (https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
- Location of Hashcat
- Location and Name of the Hash u want to attack
- Location of the folder containing the dictionaries
- if u want to do True- or Veracrypt(if unknown try Truecrypt first, as it is much faster overall)
